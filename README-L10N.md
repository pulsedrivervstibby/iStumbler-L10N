## Strings

iStumbler has a number of modules and plugins each with a seperate strings file, including various xib files, internal frameworks and plugins.


## Extracting Strings

ibtool can be used to extract strings from xib files

    // this works but isn't reccomended
    find . -name \*.xib | xargs -t -I '{}' ibtool --generate-strings-file '{}'_xib.strings '{}'

    // after property setting up the projects
    find . -name '*.strings' | cpio -pvdumB ../iStumbler-L10N/

    // TODO create a script to preview the changes in the running app

but honestly, it makes a mess if you try to update strings, so expect to manually upte them


## Marking Strings

Not every string needs translating.

    /* '' don't translate this one */
    "string" = "string";/**/

    /* ! review this one in the UI */
    "string" = "string";/*!*/

    /* ? machine or dictionary translated */
    "string" = "string";/*?*/"
